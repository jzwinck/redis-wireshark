== redis-wireshark ==

=== Motivation ===

To watch the network activity associated with Redis using the popular tool Wireshark (formerly Ethereal).

=== Usage ===

To use this, copy redis-wireshark.lua to any filename you like under [https://www.wireshark.org/docs/wsug_html_chunked/ChPluginFolders.html ~/.local/lib/wireshark/plugins].
Then when you run Wireshark it will understand TCP communications on port 6379 as Redis messages,
and will know how to interpret them.  It also works with the command-line program tshark.

=== Notes ===

Depending on your system configuration, you may need to be root to capture live traffic.
Since running plugins as root is not necessarily a great idea, try capturing some data to a PCAP file,
then load it with the plugin after running Wireshark as an unprivileged user.
